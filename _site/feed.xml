<p>The steps were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A pre-processing step running across a small CPU cluster</li>
  <li>A processing step running on a 100-machine CPU cluster</li>
  <li>A calibration step running on one machine</li>
  <li>A processing step running on a 100-machine GPU cluster</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>After investigating a few different architectures, I concluded that AWS Batch provided the best combination of features we needed. Designed 
for high performance computing (HPC), AWS Batch is a thin wrapper around AWS Elastic Container Service that allows
users to run jobs in a scalable cluster and chain them together into pipelines.</p>

<p>The biggest issue I ran into was gaps in documentation, particularly around AWS Batch and using GPUs inside Docker containers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/aws-architecture.png" alt="aws-architecture" title="AWS Architecture" /></p>

<p>The architecture I ended up choosing uses CircleCI to push Docker images to Amazon ECR. Those images are later used by 
AWS Batch to launch ECS clusters to run jobs on CPU and GPU clusters. That’s a bit of a mouthful, so I’ll try to unpack the architecture in 
the rest of this post.</p>

<h2 id="code-deployment">Code Deployment</h2>

<p>The first order of business was cleaning up the repository. The master branch was out of date with other branches,
so I worked with the scientists to solve some tech debt.</p>

<p>Next, I Dockerized the codebase. This was complicated by GPU processing, which is architecture-dependent. 
My Mac (with an Intel GPU) wouldn’t behave in the same way as AWS (NVIDIA).</p>

<p>I ended up revising this dozens of times before I got it right. Here’s a snippet of the Dockerfile ended up with:</p>
<div class="language-docker highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> python:2.7-jessie</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After I got Docker images working, I set up CircleCI to run builds and tests, and deploy images to Amazon’s EC2 Container Registry (ECR).</p>

<h2 id="getting-things-running">Getting things running</h2>

<p>The goal of the client was to create a simple way to set up, run, and monitor batch jobs.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Setup is performed by a series of CloudFormation templates, each of which exports variables that can be subsequently
used by other templates.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up permissions (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy_iam_roles.yaml</code>)</li>
  <li>Set up an ECR repository (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy_ecr_repository.yaml</code>)</li>
  <li>Set up a custom GPU AMI based on Amazon Linux with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvidia-docker2</code> installed (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy_custom_ami.yaml</code>)</li>
  <li>Set up AWS Batch queues, CPU and GPU compute environments of spot instances, and job definitions. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deploy_batch_env.yaml</code>)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cli-run-monitor-and-stop-jobs">CLI: run, monitor, and stop jobs</h3>

<p>For running the pipeline, I built a simple command line tool that can launch new pipelines, monitor existing ones, and 
stop jobs if things go wrong.</p>

<h3 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h3>

<p>AWS Batch launches either normal jobs (1 Docker container) or “array jobs” (any number of Docker containers) for each step. Those 
Docker containers in turn run on a cluster of EC2 instances.</p>

<p>The CLI will decide based on the job name which of two queues to run the job in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An auto-managed CPU-optimized cluster of standard AMIs</li>
  <li>A self-managed GPU-optimized cluster using a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Docker container in a cluster receives the following environment variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWS_BATCH_JOB_ARRAY_INDEX</code>: an integer passed in by AWS to indicate which machine is running. This is the only 
variable that distinguishes jobs from each other, a limitation imposed by AWS Batch.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARRAY_SIZE</code>: the total number of jobs running in a step of the pipeline.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIST_FILE_S3_PATH</code>: a link to S3 where commands are being housed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To calculate which commands it should execute, each instance runs:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># this cannot be changed -- it comes from Amazon

<h2 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h2>

<p>On the same reconstructions, here’s a rough benchmark for improvements. Most of the performance improvement can be attributed
to the newer hardware the jobs run on.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, there are so many online resources now for getting started with machine learning that the biggest problem
is figuring out which ones are right for you. These are the resources that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Andrew Ng’s first Coursera course</a>. I started learning machine learning with this course. It’s a great 
primer, based on the real CS229 course at Stanford and I’d recommend it to anyone starting off from a math/CS background.</li>
  <li><a href="http://a.co/heMZ59m">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a>. After I finished the Coursera course, I wanted
to start applying ML hands on. This book is the most modern one I could find, and so far it’s been great.</li>

I had been curious about startups like <a href="https://quartethealth.com">Quartet</a> and <a href="https://talkspace.com">Talkspace</a> for a while, and I wanted to explore the space in a more concrete way.</p>

<p>Zoe Hicks, a friend of mine who is therapist and mother herself, founded the Postpartum Project a few years ago to help new mothers find the care they need. This year, we decided to team up.</p>

<p>I started with a redesign of the site.</p>

<figure class="captioned-image" style="">

<h2 id="design-elements">Design Elements</h2>

<h5 id="logo">Logo</h5>

<figure class="captioned-image" style="">
    <img src="/assets/img/ppp-old-new-logos.jpg" alt="Redesign of the logo" style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>Redesign of the logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My goal in updating the logo was to create a memorable brand that symbolizes the link between parents and children. I 
considered hands, or arms holding a child. In the end, I chose to use feet because of how important walking is in 
childhood development. Feet also symbolize moving forward for the 1/5 of women who experience postpartum depression.</p>

<p>Finally, because Zoe is thinking of expanding with an app, we also wanted the logo to be something that could be used as an app logo.</p>

<h5 id="move-blogs-to-the-front-page">Move blogs to the front page</h5>

<p>Fundamentally, the Postpartum Project is both a blog and a provider network. We decided to move blog posts to the front 
page to highlight some of the content.</p>

<h5 id="simplified-menus">Simplified menus</h5>

<p>There were too many menu options, and many were unused. Meanwhile, login wasn’t possible directly from the front
page. I reduced the menu options, and added login functionality.</p>

<h5 id="fewer-stock-images-of-babies">Fewer stock images of babies</h5>

<p>For women who are going through postpartum depression, Zoe and I thought it might be challenging to see photos of happy babies
and families. We tried as much as possible to symbolize parenthood throughout the site without explicitly showing images of it.</p>

<h5 id="less-verbose-content">Less verbose content</h5>

<p>A lot of the content on the previous iteration of PPP was overly wordy and not very actionable. In this version, we
updated some of the pages with the most traffic so that people would be able to more easily find what they need.</p>

<h5 id="tech-debt">Tech debt</h5>

<p>Enabling a CDN, updating dependencies, and adding Google Analytics all helped modernize the way we developed the site.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>My next plans are to improve search functionality and speed of the site.</p>

<p>Working on the Postpartum Project has inspired me to understand the therapy-tech space better. There are hundreds of treatable 
mental health conditions. Multiply that with dozens of different treatment techniques and approaches, and it’s a headache to even know where 
to start looking for a therapist. Even if you find some promising therapists, getting <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/the-struggle-of-seeking-therapy-while-poor/484970/">past their voicemail</a> might 
mean calling multiple different therapists. And yet, many therapists still struggle to fill their caseloads.</p>

<p>It’s clear there’s still plenty of room for startups to improve the space.</p>]]></content><author><name>Annabel Lee</name></author><category term="projects" /><category term="tech" /><category term="design" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Postpartum Project is one of the one of the largest online resource directories of postpartum specialists, with over 10k unique users per month.

<p>Jackson and I met at a jam while he was visiting NYC, and he had a vision for adding cello to a commercial spot he was
working on. We spent a couple of sessions improvising together and went into the studio.</p>

<p>I had done a few studio recordings before, but this was my first advertising gig. I really wasn’t sure what to expect. 
As it turned out, fitting all the music we had thought about into a one minute commercial spot was totally impossible. 
We ended up just improvising something brand new in the studio.</p>]]></content><author><name>Annabel Lee</name></author><category term="music" /><category term="cello" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December of 2016, I recorded this original composition for Versace Eyewear with the unstoppable flamenco guitarist, Jackson Scott.

<p>For the 2017 Ports and Logistics <a href="https://nyc-portshackathon.devpost.com/">Hackathon</a>, we set about to take create a platform for helping
ships to form convoys for 10 - 20% in improved fuel efficiency. <!--more--> Aside from the fuel efficiency gains, 
traveling in convoys also allows ships to share resources like medical supplies rather than make expensive detours.</p>

<p>The following visualization, created by <a href="https://www.kiln.digital/">Kiln</a> and the <a href="http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy">UCL Energy Institute</a>, shows the global movement of 
ships in 2012.</p>

<p>To allow these ships to become convoys, we created <a href="http://rassaby.com/converge/">Converge</a>. The target market is small shipping companies that could 
collaborate with each other to compete with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Triple_E-class_container_ship">giant, more fuel-efficient ships</a> 
of their goliath competitors. Based on the data shown above and other ship lane data, we chose 5 of the highest-traffic 
routes for the first version of the product.</p>

<p>Each dot represents a convoy of ships traveling along one of the routes.</p>

configurable particle system in C using OpenGL buffer 
objects, instancing, and GLSL shaders.</p>

<p>We started by using fixed-pipeline OpenGL, rendering each particle as a point.
Most of the parameters are configurable, including the number of 
particles generated, the randomness spread, camera direction, 
and location of particle generation, and the physical forces.</p>

<p>We then added vertex buffer objects and instancing. Instancing 
allows us to define a single two-dimensional template billboard, 
shared by all particles. This 2-dimensional image is 
rotated to always face the camera - giving the illusion 
that the particles are 3-dimensional, while keeping the 
rendering fast.</p>

</div>

<p>Attributes that are unique to a given particle (such as size, 
color, position and age) are stored and sent to the GPU via 
buffer objects.</p>

<p>Finally, we used the GL shader language to implement different
                texture maps and animations.</p>
