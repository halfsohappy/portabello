A sweetheart table arch for my sister's wedding under a time crunch.

My sister got married on New Year's Eve 2023, and asked me around November if I'd build an arch to go over the sweetheart table where the bride and groom sit at dinner. She sent the following picture from pinterest as inspiration.

<div style="text-align: center;"> {% include captioned-image.html url="/arch/inspo.jpg" description="The Blueprint" style="height: 300px" %} </div>

Of course I agreed! And promptly forgot until two days before the wedding, when she asked to see it. Suddenly, I was on a time crunch.
